I am a writer whose current interests lie in psychology, self-help, and programming. My articles have received thousands of views, and I have written on eclectic subjects such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, student-life, psychotherapy, online-learning, and others.

I enjoy learning, and taking MOOCs is one of my hobbies. Currently, I'm doing Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science and Duke's Introductory Human Physiology. In my free time I like to read, write, watch TV, and play chess. I'm always up for a round, so shoot me a message if you're game.
